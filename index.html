      I have always wanted my whole to share my passion for films and games through the media of film.
      I have always loved Film and Cinema. It all starts back to when I saw SUCH AWESOME films like King Kong
      and the STAR WARS trilogy. Around the same time I was being exposed to all these awesome films I was also
      becoming a gamer. Starting with the Genesis and Super Nintendo. Becoming farely good and competive with games
      like Starfox and Donkey Country. Learning where all the hidden elements were in The Legend of Zelda a Link to the past,
      learning what hazard was where on certain sonic the hedgehog levels. So I guess you can say I was becoming a film buff and a gamer
      at really early age. I began making stories with my action figures like my ninja turltes
      and recording them on an old VHS camera.Creating my own adventrues and stories in my neighborhood with my
      friends inspired by movies like "Star Wars" and cartoons like "Ninja Turtles"
      where we would record our lightsaber battles or telling the story Of the awful brotherhood coming to kill the turtles.</div>

      <div class="main content">
      In 2007 I found the site "YOUTUBE" which of course is a very famous video sharing site. Eventually I would stumble upon a guy by the name of James Rolfe AKA "The Angry Nintendo Nerd" at that time on youtube in early
      2008.

      little did I know my life would change instantly. James a.k.a "Angry Video Game Nerd"(had his name changed due to legal issues)
      and I had alot of similarties. He had been making movies his whole life much like myself. So instantly I became hooked and intrested and followed james and his movie and
      game reviews. Often recording myself reviewing games in the same style. Eventually I began Posting content on My Older youtube accounts that were not me copying james but were
      my orginal adventures of my friends and I staging these crazy fights mostly inspired by video games that we were obssesed with at that time like super smash bros. or Super Mario.
      I would record us fighting and place nitendo music over top them. By this I was learing basic after effects with films. I Would also make top ten countdowns of my favorite anime moments
      or films often inspired by the top tens of Thatguywiththeglasses a.k.a "the nostalgia critic". Eventually though once youtube became the huge commerical giant it is my account would be taken
      down due to copyright claim. 4 years of content gone.This discouraged me to contuine making films for the site and starting over again. I contuined making videos but I was focusing more heavily on
      feature lengeth films. Dead and Gone was my first debut film It was a zombie film and once my friends saw it they encouraged me to keep making them. I was however more intrested in
      making stories with other mediums like Comics and Cartoons. So evenutally I took a hiatus from making films. However starting about a year ago I began making films again and posting them to my youtube channel.
      Usually short little like mini-series films about a creeper coming out a video game to stalk me or something along that nature.I also began filming my amature wrestling matches.
      I contuine to update the site with all kinds of material. Ranging from my short films to wrestling matches to top ten list to just me ranting about the game industry and such.
      I hope to someday have a very popular podcast and get a job doing what I love and talking about what I love. I hope to someday also have a complete nintendo collection like pat <thead>
